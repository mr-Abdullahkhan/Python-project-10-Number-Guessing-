🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)
===
This is a simple Python command-line number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts.

---
**📌 Project Description**

The Number Guessing Game challenges the user to guess a secret number chosen by the computer.
The player can select a difficulty level (easy or hard), which determines how many attempts are allowed.

This project helped me practice functions, loops, conditionals, user input handling, and game flow control in Python.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

* Python 3
* Command Line / Terminal
* Functions
* Conditional statements
* Loops
* Random module
* Custom ASCII art logo

**▶️ How It Works**

1. The game displays a logo and welcome message
2. The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100
3. The user chooses a difficulty level:
* Easy → 10 attempts
* Hard → 5 attempts
4. The user makes a guess
5. The program provides feedback:
* Too high
* Too low
* Correct guess
6. The number of remaining attempts is updated after each wrong guess
7. The game ends when:
* The user guesses the correct number
* The user runs out of attempts

**🎮 Example Gameplay**

    Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
    I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
    Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': easy
    
    You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number.
    Make a guess: 50
    Too high.
    Guess again.
    
    You have 9 attempts remaining to guess the number.
    Make a guess: 42
    You got it! The answer was 42

**🎯 What I Learned**

* Using functions to organize logic
* Handling user input and game state
* Implementing difficulty levels
* Using loops for repeated gameplay
* Generating random numbers
* Managing turn-based logic

---
**🚀 Future Improvements**

* Add input validation for non-numeric values
* Remove answer reveal for fair gameplay
* Add replay option
* Track best score or attempts
* Create a graphical interface (GUI)
